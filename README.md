Personal_Journal_Application
============================

Only a Windows 64-bit demo is available but I'll make sure to upload linux and windows 32bit versions in the next 2 days

[Download Demo (Windows 64 bit) Application](https://github.com/penguinsource/Personal_Journal_Application/blob/master/demo/Demo(64bit).jar?raw=true)

============================

A java-based compact and customizable journal application. Easy to use and fast to customize.

Source Code Documentation is available in the Doc folder.

NOTE:

WorldWind libraries (WorldWindLibs) are provided. In some cases, if you are using a 64-bit win version and
the 'places entry'/map is not working, try using the win32 version of the libraries.
