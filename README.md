Personal_Journal_Application
============================

A java-based customizable journal application. Easy to use and fast to customize.

Source Code Documentation is available in the Doc folder.

Will provide a small wiki soon.

NOTE:

WorldWind libraries (WorldWindLibs) are provided. In some cases, if you are using a 64-bit win version and
the 'places entry'/map is not working, try using the win32 version of the libraries.
